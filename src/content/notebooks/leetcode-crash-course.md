## Introduction to big O
- Computational complexity of an algorithm, Time and Space complexity
- Time complexity: amount of time the algorithm needs to run relative to its input size
- Space complexity: amount of memory allocated by the algorithm when run relative to its input size

- Inline expression: $f(x) = x + 1$

- New line + centered expression:
  $$
  f(x) = x + 1
  $$

$f(x) = 2x$
When $a$ â‰  $0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
This is a test for inline math: $E = mc^2$
Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following
equation.
$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$
\\[ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} \\]
