## Understand the problem
1. Understand the problem completely
2. Draw a diagram or figure and give suitable notations
3. Understand the principle part of a problem, like unknown, conditions and inputs, hypothesis and conclusions. try to generate mathematical symbols or appropriate notations for each of those parts
4. Try to restate the condition of the problem, if there are words which are too technical, try to create a diagram according to the definition of the technical term and then just restate the problem according to the observation
5. Try to seperate the conditions in multiple parts and write them down in english first. Perhaps, try to write it down in mathematical equations either word by word or understand the meaning and then write using mathematical symbols taking into account the english condition terms you jotted. if it is difficult to introduce, try to think of what is that which part of the condition are you trying to add as symbols, go back to its definition, this means that think of the actual meaning of that term and how we can use concrete symbol of that meaning instead of using just a symbol to add the condition part directly

## Devise a plan

1. Try to think of connection between input and the ouput and any other variables and data you are given, if not direct connection try to think in steps that is to introduce something in the middle which may help us to go to solution
2. Try to recall or solve a related problem with same unknown or similar unknown or even a little simpler, can we use that method to solve the problem? if we cannot directly use the method used in related problem, should we use something from the related problem as an auxilary element which may give us solution. Try to go back to the definiton, if you think you can introduce some element in the current problem dont just say it introduce it to see what happens and then try to look at the problem with different viewpoint
3. Introduce the method or the result of the auxilary theorem, problem or element that you think is necessary
4. Try to remove some part of the condition to make it a little easier to solve the problem, then gradually measure how far away are you to get to the actual solution after you removed a condition. Try to check for symmetry if there is some part of the problem that can be replaced with some other symmetrical part
5. Always try to go back to the problem to check whether you have used all data
6. Also look at the unknown which can help to work backwards, try to guess and then examine the guess, that will give us a problem to prove, try to prove or disaprove the theorem or guess proposed. Then do it step by step. we may also consider a figure where all the condition of the problem is already satisfied and then try to examine it. In terms, analysis is a way to trace the steps from the completed solution backwards getting more unknowns in the process until we find some unknown which we can easily get from the given conditions. Then, using that we retrace the steps in reverse order to get the actual unknown. This method is called Synthesis.
7. Try to decompose the problem in a simple problem or some sort of auxilary problem(solve a part of the problem) which we can solve to help get the final solution, take this approach to construct an auxilary problem -
   1. keep the unknown and change the data and the condition
   2. keep the data and change the unknown and the condition
   3. change both unknown and the data

   We can also just keep the data and the unknown and just change the condition. this is very helpful as we can firstly seperate the parts of the condition and then drop a part of the condition, use the result of every condition(locus) one by one, see how far is the unknown value and try to intersect or recombine it and get the required value. This is same for problems to prove as well. we may also use the techniques such as specialization, generalisation or analogy to create an auxilary problem from which we may get some impression of the actual unknown

## Carry out the plan

1. Carry out the plan with innate observation and try to think about if the steps are correct
2. If correct can you prove it, whether intuitively or formally

## Looking back

1. After you get a solution, always try to look the complete problem with the solution at a glance and try to derive the result differently
2. Try to optimize it a bit, cut out longer parts and add in any new things you observe
3. Try to think about different ways you can use same method to solve other problems using specialization(checking using a special case or extreme special case where we just choose one general object or objects to solve the problem), generalization(generalise one part or some parts of the condition to create a general problem) or analogy
4. Try to trace the entire path from the problem to anything in between and then to solution
5. Try to test the data with different test cases to check the result and the argument
