$f(x) = 2x$

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$

This is a test for inline math: $E = mc^2$

Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following
equation.

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$

\\[ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} \\]
